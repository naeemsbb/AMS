 AntimicroSeek

Welcome to the official repository for AntimicroSeek, an innovative prediction model designed to revolutionize the field of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) design. This project leverages advanced computational techniques to predict the efficiency of AMPs with high accuracy.

About AntimicroSeek

AntimicroSeek is built on a balanced dataset of 24,000 AMPs and non-AMPs and achieves a prediction accuracy of 92%. Our model utilizes an in-silico approach, enabling researchers and developers to forecast AMP efficacy without the need for costly and time-consuming physical experiments.

Features

- High Accuracy: 92% prediction accuracy, allowing for reliable AMP design and research.
- Large Dataset: Utilizes a balanced dataset of 24,000 entries, providing a comprehensive foundation for prediction.
- In-Silico Approach: Minimizes the need for laboratory resources while maximizing research efficiency.
